# hello-world
Just another repository (CS-HU-250 HW)

I'm a musician! Buy my music here: dougmantis.bandcamp.com
I'm actually using github to backup and track all my music files as I work on them, in a private repository. I'll share access with you if you'd like a listen. ;)

Ignore this repository. It's for homework.
